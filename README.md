## Our Favorite Species

### Phoebe
My favorite species is Achillea millefolium, or yarrow. As a child I used to visit northern Minnesota, and I loved to go for hikes and make little bouquets of wildflowers. Yarrow was always one of my favorites. For the past two summers I’ve worked as a landscaper for Parks and Rec in my hometown, and I’ve had the opportunity to design and maintain a variety of decorative and native plant gardens across the city. When I get the chance to design a native perennial garden my favorite species to include is yarrow–I love how well it holds up in the MN climate, and aesthetically I really like the color, shape, and texture of its leaves and flowers.

### Clare 
My favorite species is Vaccinium angustifolium or the Northern Lowbrush Blueberry. Common in New Hampshire and other parts of the Eastern United States. I have fond childhood memories of paddling out to what we called "blueberry island" to harvest bucketfuls of blueberries, ready to eat or be baked into blueberry cobbler. Store bought blueberries will never taste as good as wild, handpicked blueberries you had to search high and low for. I also love the book "Blueberries For Sal". I work at a summer camp, and I always make sure to take the time to read my campers this book at storytime so we all get a chance to talk about our favorite fruits.
