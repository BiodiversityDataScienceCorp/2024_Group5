## Our Favorite Species

### Phoebe
My favorite species is Achillea millefolium, or yarrow. As a child I used to visit northern Minnesota, and I loved to go for hikes and make little bouquets of wildflowers. Yarrow was always one of my favorites. For the past two summers I’ve worked as a landscaper for Parks and Rec in my hometown, and I’ve had the opportunity to design and maintain a variety of decorative and native plant gardens across the city. When I get the chance to design a native perennial garden my favorite species to include is yarrow–I love how well it holds up in the MN climate, and aesthetically I really like the color, shape, and texture of its leaves and flowers.
